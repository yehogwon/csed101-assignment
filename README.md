# 2022-Fall CSED101 ASSN
This is a repo to manage source code which have been committed to the assignments. 

- ASSN 1 : This assignment is about **selection and repetition**. The students are asked to implement a game system of a modifed version of *Indian Poker*. The game is multi-stage game so that students should have used a lot of loops. **I got 100/100 on this assignment. **

- ASSN 2 : This is about **arrays**. The students are asked to write a code to modify color of images. The program reads pixel data from a PPM file, which contains the RGB information of each pixel. Then, it converts RGB image into HSV image so that we can easily modify the hue of the image, which means a bit of math is applied here. **I got 100/100 on this assignment. **

- ASSN 3 : This is about **pointers**. The students are asked to develop a ladder game using C. This assignment is similar to the ASSN 1, which means a lot of repetition and recursion would be used here. Moreover, the program should print each step of the process, so *dynamic memory allocation* is being used to store each step dynamically. **I got 100/100 on this assignment. **

- ASSN 4 : This is about **linked lists**. The students are asked to develop a playlist manager using C. The program provides these functions: loading a playlist from a txt file, showing the playlist, adding or removing a music from the list, and saving the modified playlist. It could be pretty complicated to implement, so in my implementation, the algorithm is **not optimized**. It takes such a long time to perform *show_favorites* function. But note that this code totally works and **I got 99/100 on this assignment ** due to a single missing error message. ðŸ˜‚

If you are to optimize my implementation or find any errors, make a PR to let me know. I will be happy to know that.
